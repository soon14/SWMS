# SWMS

super warehouse management system

### Require environment

1. Jdk 17
2. gradle 8.0+

### Extends Model

> This is the customization if you found some function is not fit for you. In this model, all files are interface, you need to implement them.

### Outbound Model

##### Order process - sub model

Entities:

- Order: Representing a customer order, including the customer information, the items ordered, the quantities, and the
  status of the order.
- Customer: Representing a customer of the warehouse, including their name, address, and contact information.

Value Objects:

- Order Item: Representing a single item that has been ordered by a customer.
- Shipping Address: Representing the address where an order is to be shipped.

Aggregates:

- Order Process: Representing the overall process of managing customer orders, including creating orders, processing
  payments, and shipping orders.

Services:

- Order Management: Representing the process of managing customer orders, including creating new orders, updating the
  status of orders, and processing payments.
- Order Query: Representing the process of querying the order process for information about customer orders, such as the
  status of an order, the items ordered, and the shipping information.

> These entities, value objects, aggregates, and services form the core components of the Order process in the WMS domain and would be used to drive the design of the system. The implementation of each component would be influenced by the specific requirements of the WMS domain, and the design would need to be refined and iterated as new information becomes available.

##### Picking Model - sub model

Entities:

- Outbound Order:
- Picking Order: Represents a request to pick a certain number of items from the warehouse for shipment. This entity
  contains information such as the customer name, shipping address, and the items to be picked.
- Shipment Order:

Value Objects:

- Picking Item: Represents a specific item to be picked and contains information such as the item name, item ID, and the
  quantity to be picked.

Aggregates:

- Picking Process: Represents the overall process of picking items from the warehouse. This aggregate contains the
  Picking Order and the Picking Item entities and defines the business rules and operations for the process.

Services:

- Picking Service: A service that coordinates the actions of the Picking Process aggregate and performs the operations
  needed to fulfill a Picking Order. This service communicates with the Inventory and Shipping services to manage the
  inventory and shipment of the picked items.

> This is just one example of a Picking model in a WMS and the specific design can vary depending on the requirements and constraints of the system.

##### Shipping process - sub model

Entities:

- Shipping Order: Representing an order to ship items to a customer.
- Shipped Item: Representing a single item that has been shipped.

Value Objects:

- Shipping Information: Representing information about a shipment, including the shipping method, shipping address, and

  shipping orders, generating shipping labels, and tracking the progress of the shipping process.
- Shipping Query: Representing the process of querying the shipping process for information about shipments, such as the
  status of a shipment, the shipping address, and the shipping method.

> These entities, value objects, aggregates, and services form the core components of the Shipping process in the WMS domain and would be used to drive the design of the system. The implementation of each component would be influenced by the specific requirements of the WMS domain, and the design would need to be refined and iterated as new information becomes available.

### Warehouse Management:

Entities:

- Warehouse: Representing a physical warehouse where items are stored.
- Warehouse Location: Representing a specific location within the warehouse where items are stored.

Value Objects:

  space for incoming items, relocating items within the warehouse, and tracking the progress of the space allocation
  process.

  warehouse, including updating contact information, capacity, and address.
- Warehouse Query: Representing the process of querying the warehouse management process for information about the
  warehouse, including information about specific warehouse locations, capacity, and the status of the warehouse.

> These entities, value objects, aggregates, and services form the core components of the Warehouse Management process in the WMS domain and would be used to drive the design of the system. The implementation of each component would be influenced by the specific requirements of the WMS domain, and the design would need to be refined and iterated as new information becomes available.

### Stock Movement

Entities:

- Stock Movement: Representing a movement of stock in the warehouse, including the type of movement (e.g., incoming,
  outgoing), the quantity, and the location.

- Stock Query: Representing the process of querying the stock management process for information about stock movements,
  such as the quantity of stock in a specific location, the type of movement, and the history of stock movements.

> These entities, value objects, aggregates, and services form the core components of the Stock Movement process in the WMS domain and would be used to drive the design of the system. The implementation of each component would be influenced by the specific requirements of the WMS domain, and the design would need to be refined and iterated as new information becomes available.

### Inbound Module

Entities:

- Receiving Order: Representing an order to receive items into the warehouse.

> These entities, value objects, aggregates, and services form the core components of the Receiving process in the WMS domain and would be used to drive the design of the system. The implementation of each component would be influenced by the specific requirements of the WMS domain, and the design would need to be refined and iterated as new information becomes available.
